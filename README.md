# PasswordsGenerator

Hi ! My name is Pauline, I'm 28 and I'm a young and curious Web Developer. After finishing a bootcamp with the Iron Hack School to learn the basis of Express, React, Vite.js, Node.js, MongoDB... I decided to increase my skills by beginning a few projects with Python. 

I chose to begin my Python journey by creating a simple app to generate a strong password. Wish me luck and courage in this new discovery !
